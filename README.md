# Description

This was agreat learning experience, to add backend as well as frontend functionality to provided starter code, to create a PWA (Progressive Web Application), with offline as well as online functionality. It was also a learning experience to manually create manifest file (instead of webpack in lesson), add mongoose validations and coding for functions in the service-worker.js. Additional great learning was using connecting database to MongoAtlas and finally hosting the website on heroku!!
